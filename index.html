  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Amina Karabek, and I am currently a second-year undergraduate student here at IIT.
  My major is ITM (Information Technology and Management), and I am in this class to sharpen my website
  coding skills and advance in my web design skills. I also plan to learn the importance of human-computer
  interaction designs and the effectiveness of user-centered designs. My hobbies include reading, learning, and 
  journaling. I look forward to the course this year!</p>
